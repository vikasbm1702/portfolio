# Email Functionality Test Guide

## ✅ Error Fixed!

The "E.C.P is not enabled" error has been resolved. Here's what was wrong and how it's fixed:

### 🐛 **The Problem:**
- EmailJS environment variables were set to placeholder values (`your_service_id_here`, etc.)
- The code was trying to send emails with invalid credentials
- This caused the "E.C.P is not enabled" error (EmailJS Content Policy error)
- The error handling wasn't properly falling back to mailto

### 🔧 **The Solution:**
1. **Improved Configuration Check**: Now properly detects when EmailJS is not configured
2. **Better Error Handling**: Automatically falls back to mailto when EmailJS fails
3. **Robust Fallback**: Even if EmailJS attempts fail, it gracefully switches to email client
4. **Clear User Feedback**: Users know exactly what will happen when they submit the form

## 🧪 **How to Test:**

### **Current Behavior (EmailJS Not Configured):**
1. Go to the Contact section
2. You'll see a blue notification: "📧 This form will open your default email client to send the message directly to vikasbm.1si22cs199@gmail.com"
3. Fill out the form and click "Send Message"
4. Your default email client will open with the message pre-filled
5. You'll see a success message: "Email client opened! Please send the email from your default email application."

### **Expected Behavior (When EmailJS is Configured):**
1. Set up EmailJS credentials in `.env` file
2. The blue notification will disappear
3. Form submission will send emails directly through EmailJS
4. Success message: "Thank you! Your message has been sent successfully. I'll get back to you soon!"

## 🔧 **To Enable EmailJS (Optional):**

1. **Create EmailJS Account**: Go to https://www.emailjs.com/
2. **Set up Email Service**: Connect your Gmail/Outlook account
3. **Create Email Template**: Use the template structure in `EMAILJS_SETUP.md`
4. **Update Environment Variables**:
   ```env
   VITE_EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID=service_xxxxxxx
   VITE_EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID=template_xxxxxxx
   VITE_EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
   ```
5. **Restart Development Server**: `npm run dev`

## ✅ **Current Status:**

- ✅ **Error Fixed**: No more "E.C.P is not enabled" errors
- ✅ **Fallback Working**: Mailto functionality works perfectly
- ✅ **User Experience**: Clear feedback and smooth operation
- ✅ **Email Address**: All emails go to vikasbm.1si22cs199@gmail.com
